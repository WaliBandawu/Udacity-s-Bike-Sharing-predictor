    "### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?\n",
    "TODO: Add your explanation\n",
    "i needed to add the leaner _kwargs to to be able to remove some of the features\n",

    "## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation\n",
    "### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?\n",
    "TODO: Add your explanation\n",
    "Time series analysis shows that:\n",
    "There are data missing for last 10 days of the month. i.e; from 20th.\n",
    "The changes in the demand of every hour during weekday and weekend.\n",
    "Correlation graph showed the high correlation between month and seasonality. So, removed seasonality from features.\n",
    "Categorzed continues features like temperature, humidity, wind etc.\n",
    "### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?\n",
    "TODO: Add your explanation\n",
    "The model perform a little better\n",
    "## Hyper parameter tuning\n",
    "### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?\n",
    "TODO: Add your explanation\n",
    "it performed much better\n",

    "### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?\n",
    "TODO: Add your explanation\n",
    "Will spend more time on feature engineering and hyper parameter tuning as both are vital processess for building an efficient model.\n",

    "Problem: Better utilization of the data generated by the systems in the bike sharing industry as well as exogenous information are keys to take business advantages for firms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Obtain Data Data is obtained from the \"Bike Sharing Demand\" kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze Data Data is described, visualized and modified mainly using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seabon library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build Model Built models using Autogluon AutomML library. Initially created model without any preprocessing. Later, built models creating new features and tuning hyper parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Model Models are tested by submitting the predictions to Kaggle and compared the models based on the scroe obtained."
